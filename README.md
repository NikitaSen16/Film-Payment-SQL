# Film-Payment SQL Project


## Problem Statement

In this SQL project, we worked with a film payment dataset to analyze various aspects of the data and derive meaningful insights. The dataset contained detailed records of payments related to films, including information about customers, films, rental dates, and payment amounts. Using SQL, we performed a series of queries to answer specific questions about the dataset.  Through these analyses, we were able to uncover valuable trends and patterns in the film payment data, providing actionable insights that could inform business decisions and strategies for optimizing revenue and customer satisfaction.
